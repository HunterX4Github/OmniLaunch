# OmniLaunch 🚀

A lightweight, highly customizable LaunchPad replacement for macOS, designed for those who miss the classic navigation experience.

---

## 📖 Introduction
OmniLaunch was born out of a personal need to bring back the "classic" feel of the macOS LaunchPad. As macOS evolved, some of the flexibility of the original launcher was lost. This project is a labor of love—a hobbyist's attempt to build a faster, more customizable, and user-centric application launcher.

**OmniLaunch is and will always be free.**

## ✨ Features
- **Classic Multi-page Layout:** Smooth, swipeable pages for your apps.
- **Deep Customization:** - Adjust icon sizes and grid dimensions (rows/columns).
    - Modify title fonts and text backgrounds.
    - Customize background mask transition effects, colors, and transparency.
- **Smart Folders:** Intuitive drag-and-drop folder creation and management.
- **Custom Naming:** Rename app titles and folders within the launcher without affecting the source files.
- **Privacy Controls:** Hide apps you don't use or want to keep private.
- **Seamless Integration:** Supports "Start at Login" and silent startup.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](#) page.
2. Drag `OmniLaunch.app` to your `/Applications` folder.
3. **Recommended Setup:** Add OmniLaunch to your **Login Items** and pin it to your **Dock**. Clicking the Dock icon provides the most native, "classic LaunchPad" experience.

### ⚠️ Security Note (Gatekeeper)
Because I am an independent developer and have not yet registered for a formal Apple Developer certificate, the app is **unsigned**. 
- When you first run OmniLaunch, macOS may block it. 
- To open it: **Right-click** the app icon, select **Open**, and then click **Open** again in the dialog box.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security
- **Offline by Design:** OmniLaunch has no networking permissions. It does not (and cannot) send any data to external servers.
- **Local Only:** All configuration settings are stored locally on your machine.

## 🚧 Project Status
This is an **Alpha** version developed by an amateur enthusiast. 
- [ ] Grid layout customization is currently experimental and may have minor UI bugs.
- [ ] Multi-monitor support is being optimized.

I welcome all feedback! If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](link-to-issues).
