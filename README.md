Am I the only one who feels a bit "off" with the way LaunchPad has evolved (or been sidelined) in recent macOS versions? As a long-time Mac user and software enthusiast, I really missed the classic feel and flexibility of the original LaunchPad.

Instead of just complaining about it, I spent the last month building a replacement myself. It’s called OmniLaunch.

It’s still a work in progress, but it's finally at a usable stage. Full disclosure: This is a hobby project. I have zero intention of profiting from it—it is, and will always be, 100% free.


## ✨ Key Features:
Classic Layout: Multi-page icon grid with smooth swiping.

Deep Customization: Adjust icon sizes, title fonts, and title backgrounds to your liking.

Folder Support: Drag-and-drop icons to create folders automatically, just like you’d expect.

Custom Labels: Rename any app or folder shortcut without changing the actual app file.

Visual Aesthetics: Fully adjustable background mask effects, colors, and transparency.

Layout Control: Customizable grid rows/columns (Still experimental—please be gentle with this one!).

Privacy First: Supports hiding icons for apps you don’t want to see.

Utility: Supports "Start at Login" and multi-window app management.

## 💡 My Recommended Setup
To get the most "native" feel, I suggest adding OmniLaunch to your Login Items. It starts silently and sits in your Dock. I keep mine pinned there so I can trigger the full app list with a single click—bringing back that classic LaunchPad workflow we all know and love.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security
- Gatekeeper: I’m an independent hobbyist and haven't paid the Apple Developer fee yet. This means the app isn't "signed," so you might see a security warning when you first run it. You'll need to right-click and "Open" or allow it in System Settings.

- Zero Data: OmniLaunch has no networking capabilities. It doesn't send a single byte of data anywhere. Your privacy is 100% safe.

## 🙏 A Small Request
This is my first time publicly sharing a piece of software I’ve written. I know it’s not perfect and there might be bugs. I’m eager to improve it, so please leave your feedback, bug reports, or feature suggestions below! I'll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions.
